# Carbon Intensity
Simple carbon intensity API for the GB grid.

Initially draws from the 'current' generation fuel mix as published by Elexon via BMRS:

For avoidance of doubt, this is unrelated to National Grid's carbon intensity API, which does not appear to be currently supported (based upon activity in the GitHub).  I have no insight into how that works (although it draws from assumptions published by others in journals).
